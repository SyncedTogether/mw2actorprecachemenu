Issues With AutoPrecacher for MW2?

Common problems and fixes:

Misconstructed directory: You either selected the wrong file or don't have a dump folder in your mw2.

Precache button won't update the file: Make sure your the folder _precache.gsc is in is called "Cinematic Mod" and is located in your mods folder

IW4X/IW4M Zonebuilder won't boot up: You either don't have it installed or its renamed to something other than "iw4x.exe - Shortcut" or "iw4m.exe - Shortcut"
